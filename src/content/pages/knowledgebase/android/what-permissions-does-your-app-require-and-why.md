# What permissions does your app require and why?

Our app can ask for Location, Camera and Storage permissions.

**Location** permission is required for our 'Network Protection' feature to work. It needs to have the list of your device's known WiFi SSID names as well as the type and the name of the network you are currently connected to. This allows you to set and manage the 'Trust' status for these networks and allow the app to trigger the actions based on the rules you have defined.

The prompt asking for this permission will only appear when you enable the 'Network Protection' feature. If you don't plan to use the said feature, you can have the granted earlier permission removed.

Our app has no other need for your location other than to provide the SSID name.

**Storage** access permission is required for our app to generate the log file and attach it to your mail application if you have 'Enable logging' option enabled and would like to send us diagnostic logs to troubleshoot a certain issue.

Access to your phoneâ€™s **Camera** is needed to scan the QR code with your IVPN username for a seamless authentication experience.
