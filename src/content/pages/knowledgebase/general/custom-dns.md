# Custom DNS

IVPN apps are configured to automatically apply our internal [zero-logging](https://www.ivpn.net/blog/ivpn-no-logging-claim-verified-by-independent-audit) DNS IP address every time you connect to the VPN server to mitigate DNS leaks on your system.

We understand that in some cases, one can benefit more from using a custom DNS IP address. No matter the reason you need to use one, with IVPN, you can have it customized in just a few steps:

### Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **GUI:** Access the `Settings` area by tapping on the “gear” icon and navigate to the `DNS` tab.  Check the `Use Custom DNS` box and enter the preferred IP address.

- **Command Line:** Open a Terminal window and run: `ivpn dns 1.1.1.1`.
  Type `ivpn dns -off` to revert back to using IVPN DNS.

### Android and iOS
- Access the `Settings` area by tapping on the “gear” icon and navigate to `Custom DNS`. Toggle the `Use Custom DNS` switch on and enter the preferred IP address.

### DNS-over-HTTPS

iOS app supports DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS for queries when the VPN is connected or disconnected.  These settings are available in the app's `Settings`.

Windows, macOS, and Linux apps support DNS-over-HTTPS for queries when the VPN is connected.  These settings are available in the app's `Settings->DNS`.

DNS requests made to public DNS servers will first pass through the VPN tunnel, so there is still a level of privacy and security in place when using a Custom DNS server.

Custom DNS will only work with either OpenVPN or WireGuard protocol. You cannot use Custom DNS together with AntiTracker as it overrides the IP address you have specified in the Custom DNS field.  At this time, only IPv4 addresses are supported.
