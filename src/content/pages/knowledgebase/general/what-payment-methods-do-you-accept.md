# What payment methods do you accept?

IVPN accepts the following payment methods via our website:

* Bitcoin (via our own BTCPay server)
* Monero (self-hosted)
* PayPal
* Credit/Debit Cards (except American Express and any types of Prepaid/Gift Cards)
* In-app payments via our mobile apps for [iOS](/apps-ios/) and [Android](/apps-android/) (Play Store version only)
* Physical voucher cards
* Cash

To pay with cash see [how can I pay with cash](/knowledgebase/billing/how-can-i-pay-with-cash/). Voucher cards can be purchased on [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BL8FWDRL).

We run our own nodes for both Bitcoin and Monero.
