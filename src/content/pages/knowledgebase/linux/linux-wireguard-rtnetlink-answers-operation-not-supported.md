# WireGuard - "RTNETLINK answers: Operation not supported"

If you are trying to establish a WireGuard connection with a **wg-quick** command and receive the following error..:

```
$ ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard
RNETLINK answers: Operation not supported
Unable to access interface: Protocol not supported
```

..most likely the **wireguard** kernel module is not loaded in your system. To fix this, open the terminal and run the following command:

```
$ sudo modprobe wireguard
```

In case the issue is still there, reboot your machine.

A chance exists that the **Secure Boot** feature is blocking the unsigned WireGuard kernel module.  In this case, you might consider either disabling the **Secure Boot** feature or signing the WireGuard module to raise the trust level.
