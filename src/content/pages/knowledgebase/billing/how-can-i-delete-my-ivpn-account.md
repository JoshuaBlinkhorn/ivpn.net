# How can I delete my IVPN account?

We respect your privacy and understand the importance of being able to have full control over your personal information. You can permanently delete your account and purge our database of any related information.

**Note: This process is irreversible.**

To delete your IVPN account with an Account ID like `i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`, log into the [Account Area](/account/login/#id), navigate to `Account settings` area, click on the `Delete account` button, and confirm the action. 

To delete your IVPN account with an Account ID like `ivpnXXXXXXXX`, log into the [Account Area](/account/login/#email), click the `Delete Account` link on the left, and confirm the action.  An active IVPN account of this format cannot be deleted.  [Contact us](/contactus/) to have your account set to an **inactive** status.

Deleting an account before requesting a refund may delay the refund process, so please consider waiting until after the refund is processed to delete your account.
