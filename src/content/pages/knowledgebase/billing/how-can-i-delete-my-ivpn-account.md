# How can I delete my IVPN account?

We respect your privacy and understand the importance of being able to have full control over your personal information. You can permanently delete your account and purge our database of any related information.

To delete your IVPN account, log into the [Account Area](/account/login/#id), navigate to `Account settings` area, click on the `Delete account` button, and confirm the action. Note: This process is irreversible.

Deleting an account before requesting a refund may delay the refund process, so please consider waiting until after the refund is processed to delete your account.
