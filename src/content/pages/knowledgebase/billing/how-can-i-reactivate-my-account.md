# How can I reactivate my account?

For IVPN Account IDs like **i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX**, log into [Account Area](/account/login/#id), click the `Add More Time` link, then make a payment.

For IVPN Account IDs like **ivpnXXXXXXXX**, [Account Area](/account/login/#email), click the blue `Renew` button, then complete the checkout page to make a payment.

If your IVPN account has been inactive for 3 months it will be automatically deleted from our systems. If you have discovered that your old IVPN account is deleted, you can generate a new one [here](/pricing/).
