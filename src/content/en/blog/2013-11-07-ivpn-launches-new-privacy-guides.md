Given the constant attacks on online privacy, from both government agencies and corporate interests, the practice of keeping your data private and secure has never been more relevant nor more important.

However, the online privacy landscape can often look incredibly arcane and complicated to outsiders. While using tools such as VPNs and TOR is fairly straight forward, it's often difficult to find clear and concise information on going beyond this to achieve a much greater level of privacy.

That's why we've created a new series of [freely available privacy guides][1] that offer both an overview of online privacy basics and step-by-step guides for much deeper privacy protection.

We've got a general [introduction to privacy and anonymity][2], [TOR vs I2P][3], [applying risk management to privacy][4] and the benefits of [using TOR with a VPN][5].

But our biggest addition is our [new eight-part guide][6] on using Virtual Machines, VPNs and TOR.

This guide covers creating a basic setup using multiple workspace VMs, advanced VM and VPN set-ups, explanations on how to set-up Linux hosting machines for numerous VMs, creating pfSense router/firewall VMs, paying for VPNs anonymously and creating nest chains of VPNs and TOR. Perfect if you're looking for a comprehensive guide to going beyond VPNs and TOR.

Be sure to check our [privacy guide section][1] regularly, as we'll be adding additional guides over the coming months.
