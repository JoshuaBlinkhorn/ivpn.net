IVPN is working towards a future where mass surveillance is not a key part of our reality. To make our VPN service more accessible to customers looking for privacy protection we are introducing a new, more affordable subscription plan. 

Customers signing up today have the chance to choose between IVPN Standard, covering up to 2 personal devices, and IVPN Pro covering up to 7, with additional tools such as Multi-hop and Port forwarding available.

> July 2023 update: Port Forwarding is being phased out from the IVPN service and is no longer offered to new customers.\
> You can find more information in a [blog post][1] about this change.

Below is a detailed comparison of our new plans:


|          |             |    |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Plan** | **IVPN Standard** | **IVPN Pro** |
| Monthly price | $6 | $10 |
| Annual price | $60 | $100 |
| Devices covered | 2 | 7 |
| All locations and protocols accessible | ✅ | ✅ |
| AntiTracker | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-hop | ❌ | ✅ |
| Port Forwarding | ❌ | ❌ |


A note to current IVPN customers: all existing subscriptions are converted to IVPN Pro with the added benefit of 7 device coverage, improved from the previous limit of 5. Moving forward, IVPN Pro Quarterly plans cost $30 and will not be offered to new subscribers.

With any questions about our new plans please [contact][2] our customer service team directly.
