Improving the user experience for Linux customers has been a big priority for us in 2020. Earlier this year we released a fully featured CLI app. Today, following the redesigned Android and iOS/iPadOS apps, we are releasing the next iteration of our Linux app with a graphical interface.

A quick overview of the app:

*Interactive map with server choice screens for single- and multi-hop connections*

We have tested the app on current Debian and Red Hat based distributions including CentOS, Debian 64, Fedora and Ubuntu. Your mileage may vary - [let us know](https://www.ivpn.net/contactus/ "https\://www.ivpn.net/contactus/") if you encounter any issues.

The app is open source - you can review its code and contribute [on GitHub](https://github.com/ivpn/desktop-app).

Download IVPN for Linux [here](https://www.ivpn.net/apps-linux/) to get started. [Contact us](https://www.ivpn.net/contactus/ "https\://www.ivpn.net/contactus/") if you have any feedback or suggestions.
