      Very happy with the Android app! Any chance you'll make a similar app for Linux/Ubuntu as well?

Today we're pleased to release updates for our mac and windows clients. The new clients are available immediately for new and existing customers. To download the latest version, just visit the [IVPN for macOS][1] and [IVPN for Windows][2] pages.

The aim of this update it to bring our desktop apps in line with our new android and iOS apps in terms of layout, design and usability, and to build on the feedback we've received from our users.

## Update summary

A few bigger changes:

  * Mac and Windows users will see a new interface. This new layout should; 
      * Remove the need to log in before every connection
      * Make the set up and first connection process more intuitive
      * Make multi-hop easier to use and easier to configure
      * Improve consistency across desktop clients and mobile apps
  * Mac users now have the option to "show icon in system dock" in their preferences. No more '&#8230;er&#8230; im.. sure I er&#8230; had a window open?&#8230; somewhere?&#8230;'
  * We have implemented one of the top feature requests - the ability for the app to automatically select different protocol and ports if it detects that it is behind a restrictive firewall.
  * Start at login should now work for all users.
  * We've also squashed a few other bugs and improved overall performance and stability.

## How can I get it?

To download the latest version, just visit the IVPN for macOS and IVPN for Windows pages. If you do not upgrade right away, don't worry, your client will automatically update in the next few weeks.

## How can I let you know what I think of it?

As always, please let us know what you think about the changes we've made, and what you think we should do next by emailing support@ivpn.net.

P.S if you haven't already, please download our mobile apps for iOS and Android.

A few months back we did a quiet launch of our mobile apps for Android and iOS. We wanted to ensure they were as stable and polished as we could before general release. We're now looking to make these available to all of our users. That means no more openVPN configurations on mobile.

You can download the apps by visiting the [IVPN for iOS][3] and [IVPN for android][4] pages, or if you're on desktop, just scan these QR codes.
