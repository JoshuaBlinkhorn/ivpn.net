      # Who is behind IVPN?

      IVPN is run by a team of information security experts and privacy activists. The founding team is a group of security professionals who met whilst studying information security at the University of London, UK (Royal Holloway). IVPN has been around since 2009, far longer than most VPN services.

    content_column_1: >-
      #### Privacy is necessary for personal autonomy


      We believe privacy is a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of the self. The power to selectively reveal oneself to the world is under attack from governments and corporations. We are fighting back.
    content_column_2: >-
      #### Freedom is necessary for an open society


      We believe you have the right to freedom of opinion and expression online without interference or surveillance. Freedom leads to enhanced expressions of creativity and original thought. We are determined to protect this right.
  - type: text_two_column
    content_column_1: >-
      #### Surveillance can not be the answer


      Advanced surveillance tools like device monitoring and facial recognition technologies are being deployed at a rapid pace. We refuse to accept that these tools are necessary for a safe society and call on governments to roll back their use.
    content_column_2: >-
      #### Privacy requires strong security


      We need tools enabled by strong encryption to protect ourselves against hostile adversaries. With the right set of protections we can once again control what we share with those we don’t know and can’t trust.
