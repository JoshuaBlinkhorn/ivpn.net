      # Resist Online Surveillance 

      What you do online can be tracked by organizations you may not know or trust and become part of a permanent record. A VPN can’t solve this on its own, but can prevent your ISP from being able to share or sell your data.

      ### Despite what many VPN providers advertise VPNs are useless (at best ineffective) at:

      <ul class="list--is-red">
      <li>Achieving anonymity.</li>
      <li>Preventing Google or Facebook from collecting your private data.</li>
      <li>Preventing unwanted profiling by social networks or search engines.</li>
      <li>Providing better security when ‘working from home’.</li>
      <li>Protecting your passwords.</li>
      <li>Hiding your mobile phone location (GPS).</li>
      <li>Helping you avoid data breaches on services you use online.</li>
      <li>Defending against “cyber threats” and identity theft.</li>

      </ul>

      ### Do not rely on a VPN to protect you in any of the above scenarios. 

    content_column_2: >
      ### However, a trustworthy VPN can be very effective at:


      * Encrypting your data so your ISP or mobile network provider cannot monitor or log your online activity. Without a VPN, HTTPS still exposes the domain name or IP address you are visiting to the ISP.

      * Encrypting your DNS requests so your ISP or mobile network provider cannot monitor or log the domains you visit. 

      * Increasing your security on untrusted public networks by preventing MITM attacks.

      * Masking your IP address from websites and servers you connect to.

      * Circumventing censorship or geographical blocks on websites and content.

      Using a VPN should be part of an overall strategy to protect your privacy - **but only if you trust the VPN provider more than your ISP**.
