      # Ethical Guidelines

      We consider the effects of our choices with regarding to running our service. We follow a privacy-first mindset that goes beyond the basics.


      Every decision matters: how and what we communicate to new customers, what information we collect and what tools we use to improve our service.

      We believe in leading by example, and commit to the following:
      
      #### No personal information

      We aim for zero user information collected as defined in our concise [privacy policy](https://www.ivpn.net/privacy). We don’t ask for your email address or any other personal information.

      #### No trackers

      Trackers by ad companies and social networks monitor your actions and aid in profiling you. You won’t find them on ivpn.net - we are a tracking free provider.

      #### No third-party tools

      Tools like Google Analytics collect personally identifiable information. We use software hosted only on IVPN controlled servers to ensure your privacy.

      #### No secrets

      IVPN’s [ownership, company structure and team](/team/) is public, so you know who is responsible for protecting your privacy.

      #### No false promises

      Some services try to convince everyone to get a VPN and become anonymous online. We don't advertise benefits that are not attainable by using a VPN.

      #### Openness and accountability 

      Our applications are open source and available for review on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/ivpn). We commission regular [audits](https://www.ivpn.net/blog/tags/audit/) to back up our claims.

      ## How we don’t do marketing
      
      We are committed to spreading the word about IVPN’s mission and help more people protect their privacy.  Considering the state of modern marketing, this is a challenging task.


      We consider most marketing methods harmful, and refuse to engage in them. The following list represents all tactics we have considered and either rejected or eliminated over the years.
      
      #### Paid reviews

      We have closed down our affiliate program to protest against the practice of paid reviews and misleading recommendations by “best VPN” websites.
      
      #### Surveillance ads

      Surveillance ads use personal information and behavioral data for personal targeting and retargeting purposes. We reject Facebook, Google and all forms of programmatic advertising.

      #### Dark patterns
      
      We shun fake reviews, made up social proofs, countdown timers, expiring deals, exit consoles and tricks that make it hard to cancel our service.

      #### Fear, uncertainty and doubt

      Pushing subscriptions with scare tactics is common in the VPN industry. We won’t claim that everyone without a VPN is under grave threat.

      #### Buying endorsements

      We believe influencers and YouTube creators with no information security expertise should not endorse VPN services in exchange for payment.

      #### Spam
    
      We shun spam on social media and buying email lists of prospective customers, two marketing tactics frequently used by VPN providers.
