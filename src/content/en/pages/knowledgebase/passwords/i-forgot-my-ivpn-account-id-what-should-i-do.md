# I forgot my IVPN Account ID. What should I do?

The IVPN username begins with letters 'i-..' or 'ivpn..'

To locate the IVPN username in old, 'ivpnXXXXXXXX' format, log in to the [Client Area](/account/) with your email address and your current password.

Your IVPN username can also be found in the **Account details** area of our mobile apps or by clicking on the small IVPN app icon in your menu bar/system tray and navigating to **Account** menu element.

We can also try and look up your account ID if you can send us an email (support@ivpn.net) with the information of your last purchase, such as **Invoice ID**, **Payment method** used, **Date and time** of the payment and **Amount paid**. **The last 4 digits of your bank card** (if paid with card), **Transaction ID** if it was a PayPal or a Bitcoin purchase.
