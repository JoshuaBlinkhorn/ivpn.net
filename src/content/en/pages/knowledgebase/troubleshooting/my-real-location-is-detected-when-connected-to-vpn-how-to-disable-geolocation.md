# My real location is detected when connected to VPN. How to disable geolocation?

Most modern browsers implement the [geolocation API](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) as defined by the W3C which enables browsers to detect the geographic location of the device. This enables web services that rely on location information to function correctly. The specification doesn't define the location sources but the following are commonly used:

1. Global Positioning System (GPS)
2. Available Wi-Fi networks and signal strengths
3. GSM/CDMA cell IDs
4. IP address

If you are connected to IVPN the IP address lookup should return the location of the VPN server. However, if your browser is configured to use any of the alternate location sources then your actual location may be revealed to web services. Most commonly your Wi-Fi network information will be used as there are large databases that map Wi-Fi networks to a geographic location (usually created by cars with GPS & Wi-Fi e.g. Google Street View cars).
