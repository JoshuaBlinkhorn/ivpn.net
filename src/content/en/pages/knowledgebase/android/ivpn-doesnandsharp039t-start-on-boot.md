# IVPN doesn't start on boot

If the IVPN app does not start up automatically when your device boots up, check the following, please:

1. Make sure that you have the latest version of IVPN app installed on your device.
2. On your device, navigate to `Settings` - `Battery` - `Battery Optimisation` and verify that **Automatic optimisation** for IVPN app is **Disabled**.
3. Some vendors, e.g. Xiaomi, might require you to provide additional permission to allow app Autostart on boot. Navigate to `Settings` - `Permissions` - `Autostart` and tap on the switch next to the IVPN app icon to have it enabled.
