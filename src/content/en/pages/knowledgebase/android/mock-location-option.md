# Mock Location Option

Most Android devices have a built-in feature that helps you spoof your location with the ‘Mock location’ option. This feature is designed for developers, so to take advantage of it you need to enable Developer Options. We have prepared a [guide](/knowledgebase/android/developer-options-on-the-android-phone/) to do that - we suggest starting here. 

When you select IVPN as a mock location app you enable fake location information to be relayed to the GPS network and your phone network operator. The mock location will match the gateway location you connected to.

### Enable Mock Location

To use this feature, go to **Settings > System > Advanced > Developer Options** and choose **Select mock location app** option in the **Debugging**.

Now choose the IVPN app on the next opened screen.

The alternative way to find **Select mock location app** option is to search for this option in your device's settings - just like in the screenshot below.
