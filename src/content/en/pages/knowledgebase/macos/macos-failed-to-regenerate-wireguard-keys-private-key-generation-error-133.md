# macOS - Failed to regenerate WireGuard keys. Private key generation error: 133

This error is caused when you attempt to connect to a WireGuard server using an old version of macOS. To use WireGuard, your device has to be running on [macOS version 10.14 or later](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?mt=12).

Updating your macOS device to a supported version will resolve this issue. If updating is not feasible, you can continue connecting using OpenVPN or [IPSec with IKEv2 VPN protocol](/setup/macos-ipsec-with-ikev2/).
