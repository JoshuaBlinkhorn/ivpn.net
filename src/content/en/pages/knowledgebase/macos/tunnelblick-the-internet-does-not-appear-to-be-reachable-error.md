# Tunnelblick - "the internet does not appear to be reachable" error

This issue is caused by the Tunnelblick DNS configuration. Please follow the steps below to resolve it:

1. Click on the Tunnelblick icon in the taskbar and choose `VPN Details`.
2. On the Details window, click on `Settings`. Click on the `Set DNS/WINS` option and select `Set nameserver` and re-connect.
3. If that does not work, set it to `nameserver (3.0b10)` and re-connect.
