# PayPal won't let me pay with my credit card. Can you help?

Unfortunately, we do not have any control over how PayPal collects payments from customers. Our servers simply pass a request to PayPal to collect payment (this happens during the redirect to PayPal's website) and if payment is successful our servers are notified and the account is provisioned. As far as we know PayPal only accepts credit cards from non-PayPal customers based in the USA.

If you are having problems paying with PayPal, you will need to contact PayPal to investigate the issue or try alternative payment methods available on the checkout page.
