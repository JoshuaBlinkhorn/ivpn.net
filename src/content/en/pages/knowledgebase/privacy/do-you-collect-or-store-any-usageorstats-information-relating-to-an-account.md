# Do you collect or store any usage/stats information relating to an account?

Unlike many service providers, IVPN purposefully does not log any usage data associated with an account as we provide an unlimited and unrestricted quota-free service.

A device count is maintained to enforce our [device limits](/knowledgebase/general/how-many-devices-or-simultaneous-connections-can-i-have-to-ivpn/) for IVPN Pro and IVPN Standard plans.  For IVPN Account IDs like **i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX**, a [Device Management](/knowledgebase/general/device-management-faq/) feature is available to see and manage devices.  No specific device details, like the operating system, are collected, only the count.
