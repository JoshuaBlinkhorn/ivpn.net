# What happens if you receive a legal notice such as a DMCA for copyright material that I have downloaded?

When our customers are connected to our VPN service with the IVPN App's kill switch firewall active, their real details, like IP address and location, remain private, so such notices are directed to IVPN and our legal department will issue an appropriate response. Since we store no connection logs, we couldn't associate a request with a customer identity even if legally compelled to do so.
