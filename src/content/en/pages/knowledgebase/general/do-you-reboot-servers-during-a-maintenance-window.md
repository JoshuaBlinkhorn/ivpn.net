# Do you reboot servers during a maintenance window?

Yes, when necessary we perform scheduled upgrades and maintenance of the network between 03:00-04:00 EST (GMT -5) on Sundays. We recommend following our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ivpnstatus) account for notices of when there may be brief outages.
