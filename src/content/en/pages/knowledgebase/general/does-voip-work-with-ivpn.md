# Does VoIP work with IVPN?

In general, VoIP (Voice over IP) services will work properly with IVPN. These services are forwarded through the VPN just like all other services. 

Please take into account that VoIP services are very dependent on latency therefore the quality of the call may vary greatly depending on your internet connection and the distance from you to the VPN server and the VPN server to the VoIP endpoint.
