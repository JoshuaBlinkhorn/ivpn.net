# What speed can I expect / how fast is IVPN?

This is a difficult question to answer accurately without testing. All our servers are deployed on industry-leading tier-1 multi-gigabit networks with full-duplex gigabit ethernet interfaces. However, the performance you experience when connected to the IVPN network is based on much more than the theoretical maximum throughput of our servers.

We maintain a very low ratio of users per server to ensure sufficient bandwidth is available at all times. Most customers in the USA and Europe find that they can sustain around 70% of the underlying Internet bandwidth depending on factors such as time of day and whether the server is on the same continent. When testing, always use a downloading application that can open enough download processes to saturate your connection.

For more information about the speed of our network, see [what makes IVPN so fast](/knowledgebase/general/what-makes-ivpn-so-fast/).

Although we do not have a free trial option, we offer an affordable one week paid plan which can be used to test the speed of our servers. With our [30-day money-back guarantee](/refunds/), you can [sign up](/signup/) and try IVPN with no risks.
