# Does IVPN support Roku media players?

Roku media players do not have a built-in VPN client and cannot natively run any VPN client software including IVPN.

You can still share an IVPN connection with a Roku media player by using a supported VPN router. Please see our [Routers Setup](/setup/router/) page for more information.
