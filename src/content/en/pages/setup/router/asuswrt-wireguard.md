## Asuswrt WireGuard Setup Guide

<div markdown="1" class="notice notice--warning">
This guide was produced using Asus stock firmware v3.0.0.4.388_21732
</div>

### Configuring the VPN tunnel

1. [Generate and download](/account/wireguard-config) the .zip archive containing the WireGuard config file with the selected server and configuration

    <div markdown="1" class="notice notice--info">
    WireGuard config file generator is only available for accounts that were created after November 2020 (account ID format: i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX). If you have an IVPN subscription created before this date (account ID format: ivpnXXXXXXXX), and wish to make use of the config file generator, contact our customer service to help you make the switch.
    </div>

2. Extract the archive, launch the web browser and enter the IP address of your router, which is usually `192.168.1.1`

3. Once logged in, navigate to `VPN` â€“ `VPN Fusion` tab & click on the `Add profile` button
