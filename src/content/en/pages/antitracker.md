# AntiTracker

AntiTracker is a built-in tool for IVPN apps that blocks ads, web trackers, adware and malware. It prevents snooping on your activities by social networks, data brokers and marketers. This provides additional privacy protection on top of the regular VPN benefits gained by using IVPN.

Most websites and apps either run ads or pass on user data to third parties, enabling companies to build a detailed profile of your preferences. Besides profiting from ads, site operators might get paid by the third parties for valuable information about your behavior.

With AntiTracker enabled in the IVPN apps, network connection requests by third-party trackers are stopped. This prevents companies from profiling you based on the actions you have taken in a browser or in apps. Since AntiTracker blocks advertising services, they won't collect your personal information, and ads targeted to you won’t follow you around.

For stronger protection against the leaders of the surveillance economy, you can also block domains for Facebook and Google services by enabling AntiTracker's Hardcore mode.
