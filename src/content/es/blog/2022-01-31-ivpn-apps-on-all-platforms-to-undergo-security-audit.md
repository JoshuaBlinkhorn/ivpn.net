Last year in March 2021 we published a comprehensive 3rd party audit of our IVPN apps for all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). As part of our ongoing commitment to annual audits, we will again be engaging cure53, an independent firm who possess the necessary experience after completing numerous similar projects in the industry. The audit is scheduled to start next week (7 Feb 2022) and we expect to publish the results no later than end of March 2022.
