Consistent with our pledge to conduct a yearly review of our systems, we have commissioned the independent security auditing organisation [Cure53](https://cure53.de/) to perform a security audit in March 2024. 

As we remarked [last year](https://www.ivpn.net/blog/ivpn-infrastructure-fifth-audit-announcement/), audits we arrange focus on parts of our systems that received significant updates. Accordingly, the scope of the sixth annual security audit will include:

* IVPN website

* IVPN web API

* Related IVPN Web Servers & Infrastructure

The audit will be undertaken by 3 security auditors. We expect a conclusion for the audit and publication of results to happen within the next two months.
