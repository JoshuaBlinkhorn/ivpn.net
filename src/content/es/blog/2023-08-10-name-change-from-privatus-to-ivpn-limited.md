We have officially changed the name of the company operating IVPN from Privatus Limited to IVPN Limited. Ownership structure, jurisdiction, address and administrative registration details are unchanged.  

The reason for this move is to bring our product and brand name into alignment, reducing confusion and providing clarity to customers, partners and other parties about the operator of the service.

To reiterate, this change only concerns the name of the company, and has no effect on:

* Ownership structure of the company
* Team behind IVPN
* Registration number or other company details
* Gibraltar jurisdiction, registered address 
* Legal guidelines, processes for data requests and transparency reports

In the coming days, we will update the company name on various assets of IVPN, including, but not limited to, different pages of our website, apps, and GitHub pages. 

Our new company details, for reference:

*IVPN Limited
5 Secretaryâ€™s lane
GX11 1AA
Gibraltar*
