IVPN for Android app v2.4.0 is now available to download from the Play Store and our website. Two key additions to this version allow you to bypass the VPN for local networks and to mock your location information.

With the ‘Bypass VPN for local networks’ feature you can access devices on the local network whilst connected e.g. your network printer.

The Mock location option offers additional privacy gains. There are numerous ways to track information about you while you are using an Android device - chief amongst them is harvesting your GPS location. The data from this source can be used, for example, by advertising networks to generate personalized ads targeting you. 

To help you prevent this problem, we have added the ‘Mock Location’ feature to the IVPN app. It allows matching your GPS location with a VPN server location. To enable this feature go to the advanced settings section in the IVPN client and follow the setup guides - some steps will require you to change device settings. 

Please note that the Mock location feature is not foolproof, so we discourage relying on it if you need to protect your location information in high-risk scenarios.

We hope these additions will help you achieve a seamless always-on VPN experience and offer increased privacy protections.
