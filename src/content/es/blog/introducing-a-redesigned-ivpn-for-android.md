After kicking off the round of releases with [iOS earlier this month](https://www.ivpn.net/blog/release-revamped-ivpn-app-iphones-ipads/ "https\://www.ivpn.net/blog/release-revamped-ivpn-app-iphones-ipads/"), today we are introducing a rebuilt IVPN app for Android. The goals for this project were similar: to deliver a solution that offers better user control, a clearer overview of connection status and location, and enables a smoother setup process.

An overview on what changed:

*Select servers for Single- and Multi-Hop connections quicker on an interactive map*

*Switch protocols, network protection settings and enable AntiTracker through the pull-up menu*

*Get an overview on your subscription and set up IVPN on other devices easier*

Similarly to the iOS and iPadOS counterparts, IVPN for Android is open source. You can find the details and ways to contribute on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/ivpn/android-app).

We hope you have a smooth experience with our new Android app - please drop us a line if you have any feedback.
