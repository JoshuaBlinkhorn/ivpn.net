Today we are excited to announce the open sourcing of all IVPN applications (Android, macOS, iOS and Windows) under GPLv3 license. 

This is a first step in a multi-year plan to open source many parts of our service. The planned next step is releasing key parts of our infrastructure to the public with the ultimate goal of enabling anyone to set up and verify our VPN server configuration.

Similarly to other projects we have been working on in the past year ([security audit,][1] [defining ethical boundaries][2], [going tracking-free][3]), our aim is to improve our transparency and build trust with current and future IVPN customers. Another motivation for open sourcing was to help developers start or improve information security and privacy enhancing projects. 

Members of the IVPN team have been using, supporting, and building on Free and Open Source Software for decades in our personal and professional lives. We are happy to join the long list of companies working on open software. 

Head over to our [GitHub page][4] to review our active repositories and start working with us towards a future where open software supports individual privacy and Internet freedom.
