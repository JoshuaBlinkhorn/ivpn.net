      Great articles.
  
      In the "Why TOR with a VPN Service" I did not see your recommendation on whether to connect to the VPN before or after the TOR connection.

      I think for protecting your connection on the exit node, you would want to connect to the VPN first and then TOR.

      Can you please clarify for your readers.

      Thanks!

Here at IVPN we take privacy very seriously. Unlike many other VPNs, we aim to educate users as much as we can on the technologies and tools that are able to protect your data and online identity. That doesn't just mean proselytising our own service, but helping you understand the benefits of all privacy protection methods and how best to deploy them. So with that in mind, we'd like to introduce our new Privacy Guide section.

In our [Privacy Guide section][1] you'll find expert written guides on a range of privacy-related technologies and security practices, from comparisons between Tor and I2P, to instructions on combining privacy tools with your VPN service. Our guides will tackle some of the most common misconceptions and queries around privacy issues and will hopefully demystify some of the more complex topics around keeping your data private.

We've gone live with five guides and we'll be adding more over the coming weeks and months. Here's a rundown of what we have so far:

**[An Introduction to Privacy and Anonymity][2]**

**[Applying Risk Management to Privacy][3]**

**[An Introduction to TOR vs I2P][4]**

**[Why TOR with a VPN Service][5]**

**[How to Create a VM Within a Hidden Truecrypt Partition][6]**

We would love to get feedback from our readers on whether they find our guides helpful and, most important, what guides they'd like to see in the future. Feel free to [drop us a line here][7], or share your thoughts in the comments section below.
