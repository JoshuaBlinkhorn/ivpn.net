Our team is preparing new and revamped IVPN apps for shipping to all customers. Major changes include a redesigned UI on all platforms and the addition of GUI to our Linux app.

We invite you to get a sneak peek, test our apps over the next few weeks and help deliver a bug-free release.

**Android, macOS, Linux and Windows:** Download the beta application from the beta section on our site, install, then log in with your existing username.

For testing on desktop, make sure that you have the latest IVPN apps installed (v2.12.4 for macOS\Windows, v2.12.5 for Linux) before installing the beta version.

Note: our beta service is only available to customers who have an active subscription with IVPN. If you wish to participate in this test, but you are not a customer or your previous plan has expired, we recommend [purchasing](https://www.ivpn.net/signup/ "https\://www.ivpn.net/signup/") a new subscription.

**What to look out for while testing?**\
Hearing about your experiences is the aim of this project. While we welcome tips on improvements, we are primarily looking for reports on bugs we can fix before the full release.
