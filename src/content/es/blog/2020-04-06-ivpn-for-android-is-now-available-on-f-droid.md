This year we are working on projects that increase transparency and offer better privacy protection for our customers. In Febuary [we open sourced][1] all our client software and plan doing the same for other parts of our service. To complete the first phase of this project, we have submitted our Android client successfully to F-Droid, an open source repository for Android apps.

Members of our community suggested this step so they can bypass Google Play when using our service. With the help of F-Droid, now anyone can [install our app][2] and access important updates without any dependency on Google's privacy-violating platform.

While preparing the submission, we have found values [published][3] by the F-Droid team that align well with our own: "F-Droid respects your privacy. We don't track you, or your device. We don't track what you install. You don't need an account to use the client, and it sends no additional identifying data when talking to our web server other than its version number."

These words have resonated with us. By writing this post, we want to highlight the privacy gains from using their platform: transparency provided by [reproducible builds][4] and the option to break free from centralized app stores. 

If you are concerned about your privacy, use F-Droid for installing not just IVPN, but all apps for your Android device. If you are a developer, submitting your applications to the platform is a great move. We hope to see more privacy protecting tools published on the platform.
