# I forgot my password. What should I do?

Navigate to the [password reset](/recover/password/) page and enter your email address. You will receive instructions via email on how to reset your password. Once reset, you can log in to the Client Area using your email address and your new password.

IVPN accounts created after November 2020 with an Account ID format like `i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` use no email or password by default.  If you have added an email and password, the password reset link above is available.  Check [this article](/knowledgebase/passwords/i-forgot-my-ivpn-account-id-what-should-i-do/) if you no longer have your Account ID.
