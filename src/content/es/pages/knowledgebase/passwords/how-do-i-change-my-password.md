# How do I change my password?

For IVPN Account IDs like **i-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX**, no password is required by default.  If you have added an email address and password to your account, log into the [Account Area](/account/login/#id), click the `Account Settings` link, and click the pen icon beside **Password** on the `Authentication` tab.

For IVPN Account IDs like **ivpnXXXXXXXX**, log into the [Account Area](/account/login/#email), and click the `Change Password` link on the left side of the page.

If you are not logged in to the Account Area or if you no longer have access to your password, request a [password reset](/recover/password/).
