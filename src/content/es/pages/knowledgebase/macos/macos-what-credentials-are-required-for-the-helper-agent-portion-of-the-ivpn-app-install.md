# macOS - What credentials are required for the Helper Agent portion of the IVPN App install?

During the IVPN App's installation, there is a `login prompt` with a `padlock icon` for our helper agent. Please enter your **macOS username** and **macOS password** to grant permission as the administrator of your computer system to allow access for the networking and firewall integration.

We assign an **IVPN Account ID**, which starts with `ivpnXXXXXXXX` or `i-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx`, to your account. Please use this **IVPN Account ID** to log in to the IVPN App after the install is complete.
