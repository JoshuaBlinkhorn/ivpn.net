# Do you store any logs that could be used to identify a customer?

Our VPN servers do not store any logs that could be used to identify a customer. This is [backed up by a no-logs audit](/blog/ivpn-no-logging-claim-verified-by-independent-audit/) conducted by independent security researchers. For more info see our simple [Privacy Policy](/privacy/).
