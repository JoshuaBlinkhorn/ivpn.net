# Is IVPN compatible with AppleTV?

No AppleTV app is currently available.

IVPN is a privacy-focused VPN service and access to streaming services is [never guaranteed](/knowledgebase/general/can-i-access-hulu-or-netflix-or-bbc-iplayer-using-ivpn/).

One way to make use of our VPN service on an AppleTV device is to set up a router with a VPN connection, which the AppleTV connects through. This method provides a VPN connection to all the devices on your network.

We support a variety of router firmware projects and [setup guides are available](/setup/router/).

If your router accepts a configuration file, OpenVPN and WireGuard configuration file generators are available on the router setup page above.

Otherwise, it may be possible to flash custom firmware onto the router. Please note that you assume all risks in flashing your device. You can buy "pre-flashed" routers online if you prefer not to do this yourself:

* [FlashRouters](https://www.flashrouters.com/vpn-types/ivpn)

Vilfo offers a dedicated VPN router with IVPN pre-configured. When you receive the router all you need to do is enter your IVPN Account ID (starts with ivpn) to connect.

* [Vilfo router](https://www.vilfo.com/providers/ivpn?ref=ivpn) - Please note that if you purchase a router from Vilfo we receive a commission.
