# I paid with Bitcoin but the invoice is still unpaid. Why?

BTCPay invoices are only valid for 60 minutes due to exchange rate volatility. If a payment is received more than 60 minutes after the invoice is generated, we will need to manually process the payment.

In other cases, a payment may take a long time to confirm.  Our BTCPay server watches an invoice for 24 hours.  If a payment is confirmed after that, manual processing is required.

In both cases, to expedite the invoice completion process, please send our [billing department](/contactus/) the Bitcoin transaction ID/hash.
