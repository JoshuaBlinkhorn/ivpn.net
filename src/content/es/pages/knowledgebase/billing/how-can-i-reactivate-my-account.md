# How can I reactivate my account?

To reactivate your inactive account, login to the [Client Area](/account/login/#id) - click on `Billing Settings` - `Extend your account`, select time you would like to add and checkout with the preferred payment method.

If your IVPN account has been inactive for 3 months it will be automatically deleted from our systems. If you have discovered that your old IVPN account is deleted, you can generate a new one [here](/pricing/).
