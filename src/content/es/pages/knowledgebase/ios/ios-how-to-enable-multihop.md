# iOS - How to enable Multi-hop

Multi-hop increases privacy by sending the encrypted traffic through two countries, which makes tracking attempts extremely difficult.

1. Tap the `Multi-hop` toggle to the **ON** position (to the right). This reveals a second server location.
2. Choose whichever server you prefer for the first hop. A geographically close server may be a good choice for increased speed.
3. Choose a server in a different country as the second hop.
4. Connect.

Switch back to a single-hop connection by toggling the `Multi-hop` option **OFF**.

The Multi-hop feature is available in our Pro plan.
