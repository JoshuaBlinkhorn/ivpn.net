# "IVPN would like to add VPN configurations". Why do I see this message?

The message is a simple iOS system warning notifying you that all your traffic will be routed through the VPN tunnel. It is also informing you that our client needs to add a VPN configuration into your device's network environment which can only be done if you allow doing so. Should you disallow it, it will be impossible to connect to any of IVPN servers.

You can also receive this message in case you have just installed IVPN client and trying to establish the VPN connection for the first time. It might also be shown if you are trying to connect for the first time after reinstalling or updating the IVPN app to the newer version.
