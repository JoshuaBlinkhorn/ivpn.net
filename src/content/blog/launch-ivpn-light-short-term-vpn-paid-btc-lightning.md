Equipped with a [BTC Lightning wallet](https://bitcoiner.guide/lightning/) and some sats, you can now set up an [IVPN WireGuard tunnel](https://www.ivpn.net/light/) in minutes without creating an account or sharing any personal information. 

Benefits of using [IVPN Light](https://www.ivpn.net/light/): 

- Short duration access option, you can get a "throwaway" VPN tunnel for 3 hours or up to 30 days duration
- Priced in sats and affordable - you can purchase access for as little as 500 sats (3 hours)
- Access up to 5 locations or 1 entry-exit node MultiHop combination with one payment
- No account required - we only keep a record of your Lightning payment on our self-hosted BTCPayServer, no personal information is collected


Differences versus a regular [IVPN subscription](https://www.ivpn.net/pricing/): 

- [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) app or CLI is required to connect, IVPN apps do not support Light tunnels
- You can only pay with BTC Lightning
- To continue using the Light service after expiration, you need to purchase access again - no subscription or top-up option

Our general [Privacy Policy](https://www.ivpn.net/privacy) applies to this service.

IVPN Light is an experiment in supporting Lightning adoption. We look forward to your feedback and appreciate any ideas for improvement:
